##Now you see me - Homework 1

###Description:

    This project was about implementing geniric structures which are used to
create two lists: one that keeps decks and one that keeps cards. The functions
used for implementation are entered from the command line. 
    I added a deck or a single card within an existing deck and then parsed
through the list of cards and the list of decks using the structure that keeps
the nodes to delete the decks or the cards, shuffeled, merged, splitted or
sorted them.
    The rest of the functions are either used for displaying all the deck or
only a specific one, displaying the length of a deck or the deck number and
exiting the program. 
    Also, there are some auxiliary functions as well used to create the lists,
go to a specific node or verify if the cards are valid or not.

### Comments on the homework:

*Do you think you could have done a better implementation?
 Maybe I could if I had a lot of free time.

*What did you learn from this homework?
 I think the homework worked perfectly to help me perfect the implementation of
 geniric lists.
